      <h1>Windows10</h1>
      <p>
        Windows 10 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system
        developed by Microsoft. It is the successor to Windows 8.1, which was
        released nearly two years earlier, and itself was released to
        manufacturing on July 15, 2015, and broadly released for the general
        public on July 29, 2015.[18] Windows 10 was made available for download
        via MSDN and TechNet, as a free upgrade for retail copies of Windows 8
        and Windows 8.1 users via the Windows Store, and to Windows 7 users via
        Windows Update. Windows 10 receives new builds on an ongoing basis,
        which are available at no additional cost to users, in addition to
        additional test builds of Windows 10, which are available to Windows
        Insiders. Devices in enterprise environments can receive these updates
        at a slower pace, or use long-term support milestones that only receive
        critical updates, such as security patches, over their ten-year lifespan
        of extended support.

      <h1>Windows 11</h1>
      <p>
        Introducing Windows 11 A new Windows experience bringing you closer to
        the people and things you love. Windows 11 features major changes to the
        Windows shell influenced by the canceled Windows 10X, including a
        redesigned Start menu, the replacement of its "live tiles" with a
        separate "Widgets" panel on the taskbar, the ability to create tiled
        sets of windows that can be minimized and restored from the taskbar as a
        group, and new gaming technologies inherited from Xbox Series X and
        Series S such as Auto HDR and DirectStorage on compatible hardware.
        Internet Explorer (IE) has been replaced by the Chromium-based Microsoft
        Edge as the default web browser, and Microsoft Teams is integrated into
        the Windows shell
